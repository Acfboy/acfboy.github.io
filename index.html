        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a freshman majoring in Physics at Lanzhou University, with strong
          interests in physics, computer science, and other fun stuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by lifelong curiosity about how technology works and how
          pushing computational boundaries can transform our world, I constantly
          challenge myself to learn emerging technologies, master advanced
          tools, and explore relevant theories.
        </p>
        <p>
          During high school, I participated in the Olympiad in Informatics,
          which helped me build a solid foundation in algorithms and data
          structures. This experience not only broadened my perspective on
          technology's possibilities, but also clarified my aspirations in
          technology development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in the power of collaboration and brainstorming. While being
          an outgoing person who enjoys social activities and group projects, I
          also value quiet time for deep reading. In this age of instant online
          information, I maintain that well-structured books remain essential
          for gaining systematic understanding of any technical or scientific
          field, though there are lots of good blogs in the Internet that really
          helps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm focused on getting solid on the theory side, and
          grinding through toy projects to level up my coding chops. Once ready,
          I hope to tackle some real-world challenges â€“ that's what gets me
          pumped!
